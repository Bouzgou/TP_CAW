    <h1>features of JavaScript</h1>
    <h2>Imperative and structured</h2>
    <p>JavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., if statements, while loops, switch
        statements, do while loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function
        scoping with var; block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords let and const. Like C, JavaScript
        makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon
        insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.</p>
    <h2>Weakly typed</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.</p>

    <h1>Libraries and frameworks</h1>
    <h2>jQuery</h2>
    <p>jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event
        handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.[3] It is free, open-source software using the permissive MIT License.[4] As
        of Aug 2022, jQuery is used by 77% of the 10 million most popular websites.[5] Web analysis indicates that it is
        the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a large margin, having at least 3 to 4 times more usage than any
        other JavaScript library.[5][6]

    </p>
    <h2>React</h2>
    <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library[3] for building
        user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of
        individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page,
        mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with
        state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of
        additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.</p>

    <h1 id="point1">Security</h1>
    <h2>Cross-site vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>A common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin
        policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can cause a target Web site, such as an online banking
        website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then
        access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or
        transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use HTML escaping
        whenever displaying untrusted data.

    </p>
    <h2>Misplaced trust in the client</h2>
    <p>Developers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of
        attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all)
        because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. </p>

    <h1>Related technologies</h1>
    <h2>Java</h2>
    <p>A common misconception is that JavaScript is the same as Java. Both indeed have a C-like syntax (the C language
        being their most immediate common ancestor language). They are also typically sandboxed (when used inside a
        browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java
        keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions,
        and JavaScript's Math and Date objects are based on classes from Java 1.0. </p>
    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <p>JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of
        JavaScript's object literal syntax.
